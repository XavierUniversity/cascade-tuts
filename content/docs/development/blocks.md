# Blocks

A block is a piece of content that can be inserted into any page region. This can be 
done with or without styling. This items are commonly used for repeated content.
Such as, an "About" section that appears on every press release. This would
allow the content to be pushed out without managing it in multiple places.

## XHTML/Data Definition

XHTML / Data Definition Blocks can essentially be compared to a Page. However,
these items cannot be published on their own. They have to be assigned to a region
before being rendered to a page.

To use a simple XHTML (WYSIWYG) you simply add a new Block (`Add Content > Default > Block`) to your site
and fill in the Editor content.

To use a Data Definition, click `Properties` and assign the appropriate Data Definition
and/or meta data set.

**Reminder:** Blocks cannot be published independently and this content will only
be rendered to a page IF it is assigned on the Template, Configuration, or Page Level.

## XML

An XML Block

## Text

Content Blocks are defined as any block that uses XHTML or a Data Definition form fields for editing content

## Index

Index Blocks are dynamically generated system assets, as XML. They can be used
to aggregate folders, files or assets (or a combination of all).

Index blocks are typically used for creating dynamic content such as navigation menus,
sitemaps, etc.

Index blocks can be used on an individual folder, or across an entire site.

### Using an Index Block

Index blocks can be created by using `Add Content > Default > Block`. You will then 
select the option of `Index Block`, and placing it into a folder.
